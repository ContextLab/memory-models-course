# 🧠 Models of Memory  
### PSYC 133 @ Dartmouth

**Instructor**: Dr. Jeremy R. Manning  
**Time**: Thu 2–3:30 & Fri 3–4:30  
**Location**: Moore Library

---

# What’s This Course About? 🤔

We explore **how memory works** by building **computational models** of:
  - Human memory  
  - Neural networks  
  - Biological systems  

🧪 Expect **hands-on coding**, **discussions**, and **projects**!

---

# Goals of the Course 🎯

By the end, you'll be able to:

- Build **memory models** from scratch 💻  
- Understand how **humans store and recall** info 🧍‍♂️  
- Critically evaluate **computational models** 🧠

---

# Do I Need Experience? 🛠️

**Required**:
- Python 🐍

**Recommended**:
- Stats / Probability 📊  
- Bonus: AI, ML, Linear Algebra, Philosophy of Mind ✨

---

# Learning Style 📚

This class is **experiential**!

- 🗣️ In-class **discussions**
- 🧪 **Labs** in Google Colab
- 📈 **Problem sets** as mini research projects
- 🤝 **Group final project**

---

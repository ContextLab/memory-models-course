# 📚 How to Read a Paper  
## (When You're Building a Model)

---

## What’s the goal?

- Extract what’s **important**
- Figure out how to **replicate core results**
- Build something that **actually works**

---

## Step 1: Skim first 🔍

- Read the paper **once**, high-level only  
- Focus on:  
  - **Abstract**  
  - **Intro**  
  - **Discussion**

🧠 Skip hard parts — it's okay!

---

## Step 2: Zoom in 🔬

Re-read the paper:

- Focus on the **Results**
- Find the **core result(s)** you’ll replicate

🧪 Reproducing a figure is often enough!

---

## Step 3: Deep dive 🧠

Go **sentence by sentence** through Results + Methods  
Highlight *anything* needed to reproduce results:

- Equations 🧮  
- Algorithms ⚙️  
- Diagrams 🧭  
- Code snippets 💻  
- Implementation notes 🧱

---

## Understand everything

For each highlighted thing:

- Use AI (carefully!) 🧑‍💻  
- Watch a video / read a blog 📺  
- Try running shared code 🔁  
- Ask someone 🗣️  
- Take **lots of notes** 📝

---

## Step 4: Make a task list ✅

- From your notes, write out a **to-do list**
- Start high-level → break into sub-tasks
- Track your progress (Google Doc, GitHub Projects, etc.)

💡 Tip: Write it out by hand if it helps you think

---

## Missing a detail?

Try this:

- Re-read carefully (look for footnotes!)  
- Check **supplemental materials**  
- Look at **shared code**  
- Email the authors! 📬

---

## How to email an author 💌

- Be **clear and concise**  
- Ask **all your questions up front**  
- Be respectful of their time  
- Say thank you 🙏

---

## Be kind to yourself ❤️

This is hard!

- Take breaks 🧘  
- Talk it out (even to yourself!) 🗯️  
- Go for a walk 🚶  
- Sleep on it 😴  
- Keep chipping away 🔨

---

## Final tips 🧠

- Building from primary sources is *real science*  
- Confusion is part of the process  
- Ask questions, keep notes, keep going!

You got this 💪

# 🧠 What is a Memory Model?

---

## Models of memory = 🤖 for the mind?

A **memory model** is like a *little machine* that:

- Takes in **sequences** of inputs  
- Stores **representations**  
- Produces **memory behaviors**

🎯 It lets us *simulate* what minds (and brains) do!

---

## What's the *input* to a model? 🧩

Usually:

- A **list or sequence** of experiences  
- Could be:  
  - 📝 Words  
  - 🧠 Concepts  
  - 🌍 Sensory events  
  - 🕰️ Time-varying contexts

---

## What's the *output* from a model? 🎬

Behaviors we can measure:

- 🗣️ **Free recall**, **recognition**, etc.  
- ⌛ **Timing**, **errors**, **response curves**  
- 🔄 How memory *changes* with new input

---

## 🤔 What kinds of models will we see?

From the [course outline](https://contextlab.github.io/memory-models-course/outline.html):

- 🧠 **Hopfield nets** (attractor memory)
- 🎯 **Search & recall** processes
- 🧩 **Contextual encoding** (e.g. retrieved context model)
- 🧪 **Laplace-transform–based** systems
- 🧬 **Biological circuits** for memory
- 🤖 **Modern deep nets** (LSTMs, Transformers)

📚 We’ll build, analyze, and compare them!

---

## 🔍 How do we evaluate models?

- ❓ **Does it fit the data?** (qualitatively or quantitatively?)
- 🧪 **Does it predict new behaviors?**
- 🧠 **Does it teach us something about cognition or the brain?**

---

## 🧱 All models are approximations

> “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”  
> — George E. P. Box (1976)

We’re not trying to recreate a brain; we’re building **simplified systems** to *understand memory better*.

---

## 🎯 Goals when using models

- Break down **complex behavior** into understandable pieces  
- Generate **testable predictions**  
- Build bridges between **psychology**, **neuroscience**, and **machine learning**

🛠️ Memory models are tools — let’s learn how to use them.
